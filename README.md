# Trade war impact on US labor market coding sample
## Introduction
This file is modified from the import analysis part of my current work in progress. 
The Python file is the main file primarily for data processing and plotting. The Stata files runs regression and use event study structure to analyze the import tariff at industry and county level. The R file (to be added in the next update) estimates the counterfactual import value supposing there was no trade war using machine learning methods. The Matlab file (to be added in the next update) performs Monte-Carlo testing with simulated data.
